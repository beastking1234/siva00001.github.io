# SHAPEAI WEB DEV BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

    <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
    <p id="para" class="desc text-color">Full-stack developers are experts in both the front-end and back-end; so, the full stack of technology that makes up a website. They are proficient in both front-end and back-end languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.</p>
    <h2>Data Analyst</h2>
    <p class="para-desc">In general, experts talk about data analysts as people who collect data and use that data to provide insights. They are “translators” of raw numbers and data points into digestible information that helps to direct companies and move markets.</p>
    <h2>Software Development Engineer</h2>
    <p class="para-desc">A Software Development Engineer (SDE) is responsible for creating cross-platform applications and software systems, applying the principles of computer science, computer engineering, information technology and analysis to help organizations and individuals make informed decisions.</p>
